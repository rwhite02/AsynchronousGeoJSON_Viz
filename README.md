# AsynchronousGeoJSON_Viz

In this lab within index.html I created a web map that displays the hospital locations in Washington state using geojson data for both the hospital data and the Washington state boundary. This web map also contains a table within a side panel that displays all of the hospital addresses, their names, and the city that each hospital is within. The table also features a sort alphabetically by name button.

The example shown in the lab instructions is lcoated in earthquake.html

The hospital data can be found at [Hospitals](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WADOH::hospitals/explore?location=46.891778%2C-120.410600%2C7.43)
The Washington boundary data can be found at [WA state boundary](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/a77ee02fab3e4793b274ec52b7a523d8/explore?location=46.910787%2C-119.716152%2C6.94)
